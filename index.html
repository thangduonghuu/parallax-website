      <h2>Parallax scroll website</h2>
      <p>
        There is even a clear difference between the two characters visually on
        the page: Mr Bennet responds in short sentences, in simple indirect
        speech, or not at all, but this is “invitation enough” for Mrs Bennet to
        launch into a rambling and extended response, dominating the
        conversation in text just as she does audibly. The fact that Austen
        manages to imbue her dialogue with so much character-building realism
        means we hardly notice the amount of crucial plot exposition she has
        packed in here. This heavily expository dialogue could be a drag to get
        through, but Austen’s colorful characterization means she slips it under
        the radar with ease, forwarding both our understanding of these people
        and the world they live in simultaneously.
